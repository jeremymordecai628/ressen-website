        <h1>School History</h1>
        <p>The school was founded in January 2010 by Ms. Christine Khakasa Wekesa, an
            educationist with over 10 yearsâ€™ experience as a lecturer in various local
            universities and her spouse CPA Mumia Koroti, an experienced financial
            management specialist.
            The institution initially started at Muthangari farm and within 10 years we had a
            population of over 500(five hundred) learners. These caused the need to procure
            additional space for various amenities such as: land for setting agricultural
            demonstration plots, laboratories, sports among other facilities required for co-
            curriculum activities, Masaba A campus was opened in year 2021.Both campuses
            offers 2-6-6-3 Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) system of education and are
            registered KCPE examination Centers and approved Junior Secondary School
            Institutions.</p>
